WP Most Popular is a simple plugin which tracks your most popular blog posts based on views and lets you display them
in your blog theme or blog sidebar.

== Description ==

WP Most Popular was born out of frustration in finding a decent plugin which performs one simple task and that is to
rank your most popular blog posts.

The plugin keeps a log of your most popular posts based on views and lets you display them in your blog theme with custom
styling. You can display popular posts from the last day, 7 days, 30 days or all time.

It also comes with a sidebar widget to let you display your popular posts on your blogs sidebar.

Setting up WP Most Popular is very simple. Follow these easy steps

1. Upload the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin
3. Add sidebar widget or integrate functions in to your theme
